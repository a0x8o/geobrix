SQL examples for the PMTiles UDAF.

The PMTiles DataSource writer (`df.write.format("pmtiles").mode("overwrite").save(path)`)
is documented in `docs/docs/packages/pmtiles.mdx` — it is not a SQL function and
therefore has no `*_sql_example()` entry here.

These examples are exercised by `test_pmtiles_functions_sql.py` so they stay
green against the live `gbx_pmtiles_agg` UDAF.
