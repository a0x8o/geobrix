"""Auto-fit reduction of an oversized PMTiles archive for interactive embedding.

GeoBrix vizx targets Databricks notebooks, where an interactive map is a single
base64-embedded HTML cell capped by the Serverless cell-output limit (10 MB
default, 20 MB max). A large archive cannot embed; ``interactive_fit='downzoom'`` keeps
the experience interactive by *investing little*: drop the highest (densest)
zoom levels until the base64-rendered archive fits the budget. The user gets one
interactive map of the whole extent at reduced detail.

This is tier-agnostic (raster OR vector tiles): it rebuilds a smaller archive
from the tiles already present via the same in-memory ``Writer`` /
``build_header_info`` assembler used by ``gbx_pmtiles_agg`` -- no re-tiling, no
tippecanoe, no tile-join.

The full-detail, lossless counterpart -- ``interactive_fit='all'`` (spatially shard
into per-region sub-archives, each under budget, rendered as a multi-shard
interactive experience) -- is the planned "halo" feature and is not built here.
