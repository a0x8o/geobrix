"""Deterministic multi-tile input synthesis for the `tile_array` bench adapter.

The C3 multi-tile functions (rst_frombands / rst_combineavg / rst_merge) each
consume an ARRAY of tiles, but a corpus row carries ONE tile. This module derives
the multi-tile input from that single source and writes it to disk ONCE, so BOTH
benchmark engines (pyrx + heavy) read byte-identical input files.

Write-once-read-both is the safest cross-engine input-identity guarantee: rather
than each engine re-synthesizing (and risking subtly different GTiff encodings),
the pyrx runner synthesizes the files, and the heavy runner reads the SAME paths.
Both engines locate them via the deterministic ``synth_dir`` (computed identically
from corpus root + tile path + fn), so no coordination channel is needed beyond
agreeing on the path math.

Synthesis recipes (deterministic, idempotent):
  * ``frombands``  -> split the N-band source into N single-band GTiffs (N paths,
                      in band order; element i carries source band i).
  * ``combineavg`` -> 2 ALIGNED copies of the source (identical
                      transform/shape/CRS) so the per-pixel mean is well-defined.
  * ``merge``      -> 2 copies with OFFSET geotransform origins (origin shifted by
                      half the tile width/height) so their extents tile into a
                      union for the mosaic.

Idempotent: a given (source, fn) always writes to the same paths with the same
bytes; if the outputs already exist they are reused (re-synthesis is skipped).
