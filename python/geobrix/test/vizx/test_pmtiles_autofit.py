"""Tests for vizx PMTiles auto-fit reduction (interactive_fit='downzoom').

The reducer down-zooms an oversized archive (drops the highest zoom levels)
until the base64-rendered embed size fits the interactive budget, so a single
large archive can still display interactively at reduced detail. Tier-agnostic:
works for both raster and vector tiles by rebuilding a smaller archive from the
tiles already present (no re-tiling, no tippecanoe).
