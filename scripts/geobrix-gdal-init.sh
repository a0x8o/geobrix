# Databricks cluster init script — volume-staged GDAL install for GeoBrix.
# Same security spirit as geobrix-gdal-init-ppa.sh (fingerprint-pinned PPA +
# source-built GDAL bindings), but the slow build runs once in CI and ships
# its outputs as a single tarball attached to each GeoBrix release. Cluster
# start downloads zero bytes from the internet, verifies the bundle against
# its release-published sidecar, extracts to local disk, and installs.
#
# Trust anchors (defense in depth):
#   1. UC Volume ACL — only the release/CI process has write access to
#      VOL_DIR. This is the boundary that lets us trust the sidecar found
#      there. (Read access to the volume is broader; that's fine.)
#   2. <tarball>.sha256 sidecar (staged in VOL_DIR) — pins the byte hash of
#      the tarball. The init script reads it at runtime and refuses to
#      proceed on mismatch, so a tampered tarball fails closed before
#      extraction.
#   3. SHA256SUMS inside the tarball — per-file manifest verified
#      post-extract. Catches transport corruption + gives an auditable
#      per-file pin for forensics.
#   4. UBUNTUGIS_FPR in scripts/build-gdal-artifacts.sh — gates what enters
#      the tarball at CI build time. The GPG fingerprint check is upstream
#      of every hash above.
#
# Why sidecar (not hardcoded hash in this script):
#   The init script is itself a release artifact (attached to each GeoBrix
#   release alongside the tarball), so the script+tarball pairing is already
#   visible at the release level. The sidecar lets the operator hot-swap a
#   re-built bundle (security patch, GDAL bump) without re-cutting an init-
#   script release — they just stage the new tarball + new .sha256 in
#   VOL_DIR. Trust still binds to the UC Volume ACL.
#
# Architecture: x86_64 / amd64 only — Intel and AMD CPUs are interchangeable
# (`amd64` is just Debian's name for `x86_64`). The exclusion is ARM /
# aarch64 — AWS Graviton, Ampere, Apple Silicon, etc. — because the PPA
# ships only amd64 .debs. Pick a non-ARM instance type for this cluster.
#
# Distribution flow:
#   CI:        scripts/build-gdal-artifacts.sh → tarball + tarball.sha256
#   Release:   both attached to the GeoBrix GitHub release, alongside the
#              matching version of this script
#   Operator:  download both files, upload to VOL_DIR
#   Cluster:   this script discovers them, verifies, extracts, installs
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING
#
# 1) This script FAILS and the cluster never launches.
#    By default, this script writes its full stdout+stderr to a local
#    /tmp file and copies that file to VOL_DIR via an EXIT trap on
#    script exit. The persistent copy survives the failing cluster's
#    teardown. Path layout (one file per node per init run):
#        $VOL_DIR/_init_logs/$DB_CLUSTER_ID/$(hostname)/init_<timestamp>.log
#    Per-host subdirectories isolate driver vs worker logs (and any
#    multiple workers from each other) — no risk of two nodes racing
#    on the same path. Multiple init runs on the same node produce
#    multiple timestamped files; sort by mtime to find the latest.
#    To read everything from any working cluster:
#        %sh
#        find /Volumes/<your-vol-dir>/_init_logs/<failing-cluster-id> -type f
#        cat /Volumes/<your-vol-dir>/_init_logs/<failing-cluster-id>/<hostname>/<latest>.log
#    No env-var setup needed — reuses the VOL_DIR already configured
#    for the platform tarball.
#
#    Why the /tmp → cp dance? UC Volumes are S3-backed, and S3 objects
#    don't support append. Incremental writes from a long-running `tee`
#    process buffer at the FUSE layer and never flush if the host
#    terminates before close(). A single bulk cp from /tmp is one
#    open/write-all/close cycle that FUSE flushes as a single S3 PUT.
#    Caveat: if Databricks SIGKILLs this script (init-script TIMEOUT,
#    distinct from the script's own non-zero exit), the trap doesn't
#    run and the cp doesn't happen — the local /tmp file dies with the
#    node. dpkg failures, sha mismatches, and set-e aborts ALL run the
#    trap normally and produce a persistent log.
#
#    Override the log location by setting WS_LOG_DIR (env var or hardcoded
#    near the top of this script) if you want logs in a Workspace files
#    path or a dedicated logs volume instead.
#
#    Backstops if VOL_DIR write is denied (the script will log a WARNING
#    line via the cluster Event Log indicating this):
#      - Databricks UI: cluster page → "Event log" tab → click the
#        "Init script failure" event for the last lines of stderr.
#      - From a surviving cluster in the same workspace, before the
#        failing driver's local files are gone:
#            sudo ls /databricks/init_scripts/
#            sudo cat /databricks/init_scripts/*_geobrix-gdal-init.sh.stderr.log
#            sudo cat /databricks/init_scripts/*_geobrix-gdal-init.sh.stdout.log
#    Common causes and what to do:
#      - "no *.tar.gz.sha256 sidecar found in $VOL_DIR"     → operator
#        forgot to upload the .sha256 sidecar alongside the tarball.
#      - sha256sum -c reports "WARNING: 1 computed checksum did NOT match"
#                                                          → the tarball
#        was truncated or replaced; re-download from the release page,
#        verify locally with `sha256sum -c <tarball>.sha256`, re-upload.
#      - "dpkg: error processing ..."                       → the bundle
#        is missing a runtime dep, or a bundled runtime lib conflicts
#        with what DBR's base image pre-installs. Rebuild the platform
#        tarball locally via scripts/build-gdal-artifacts.sh against a
#        fresh ubuntu:24.04 container, smoke-test, and ship a replacement
#        release. (Build-time-only packages — `*-dev`, autotools, etc. —
#        are filtered out of the bundle by the build script; if dpkg
#        complains about one of those, that filter has regressed.)
#
# 2) This script SUCCEEDS but GDAL functions fail at runtime.
#    Run in a %sh notebook cell on the launched cluster to find the gap:
#        dpkg -l 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^ii\s+(libgdal|libproj|libgeos|gdal-bin|gdal-data|python3-gdal)'
#        python -c "from osgeo import gdal; print(gdal.__version__)"
#        ldd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgdal.so.37 | grep 'not found'
#        env | grep -i proj
#    Any "not found" line in ldd → a runtime shared lib the bundle didn't
#    ship. Compare the installed set against PACKAGES.txt inside the
#    tarball (extract locally, grep). Fix by adding the missing package
#    to scripts/build-gdal-artifacts.sh's EXTRA_SYSTEM_PKGS, rebuilding
#    the platform tarball, and recommitting.
